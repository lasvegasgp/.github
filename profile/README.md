Officially the FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN SILVER LAS VEGAS GRAND PRIX 2024, the 50-lap Grand Prix starts at 22:00 local time (UTC-8) on Saturday, 23 November, at the Las Vegas Strip Circuit in Nevada, USA.

Located in the heart of Las Vegas, the 6.2km, 17-turn circuit winds its way past iconic locations with average speeds similar to Monza, otherwise known as F1’s ‘Temple of Speed’. A Saturday night street race under lights, with the buzz and party atmosphere the resort city is famous for, and incredible entertainment off-track to match the action on it, this is definitely one of the must-attend events of the Formula 1 calendar.
